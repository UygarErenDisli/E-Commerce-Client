## ðŸ”¨ Installation
- First thing first is you must set up the back-end. If you didn't set up, you can go [here](https://github.com/UygarErenDisli/E-CommerceAPI.git) to set it up.
- When you set up back-end correctly you need back-end origins in order to send requests. 
- Clone the repository.
- After cloning the repository, open a terminal then you need to run `npm install --force`
    - This command will download all necessary packages that are required to run this project.
- If you change the default host for back-end you need to specify in three places.
    - Direct to `src/app/app.module.ts`.
    - In the `app.module.ts` add your host in both `useValue:' '` section.
    -  ` {
      provide: 'baseUrl',
      useValue: '[YourHost]/api', 
      multi: true, 
     }`
    - `{
      provide: 'domainUrl',
      useValue: '[YourHost]' !Without / in the end,
      multi: true,
    }`
    - ` JwtModule.forRoot({
        allowedDomains: ['YourHost], <= Add your host here ` 
        - ***You must use http not https otherwise you will get an unauthorized error.***
        - ***Dont forget to remove []***
- ***Optional*** If you set up Google Login, you need to put your client id in the `app.module.ts`.
    - ``` {
      provide: 'SocialAuthServiceConfig',
      useValue: {
        autoLogin: false,
        providers: [
          {
            id: GoogleLoginProvider.PROVIDER_ID,
            provider: new GoogleLoginProvider(
              '[YOURGOOGLECLIENTID]'
            ),
          },
        ],
        onError: (err) => {
          console.error(err);
        },
      } as SocialAuthServiceConfig,

- When you have done every step. Then run `ng serve` command.
    - When you see this line in the console `âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:4200/`  everything  done.
- Now you can go to `http://localhost:4200/` to look at the web site. ***Don't forget to run back-end at the background***
